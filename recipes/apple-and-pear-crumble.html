    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3><em>For the filling</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Bramley Apples, peeled</li>
        <li>2 Ready-to-eat Pears, peeled</li>
        <li>50g brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><em>Crumble Topping</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g cold butter, cubed</li>
        <li>100g plain flour</li>
        <li>60g plain oats</li>
        <li>35g brown sugar</li>
        <li>50g caster sugar</li>
        <li>20ml whole milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
       <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li> 
       
       <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sliced apples, sliced pears, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is softened slightly, too cooked and it will be mushy in the oven this will take around about 5 minutes.</li>

       <li>Transfer the cooked fruit mixture into a baking dish,mine was around 4x4 inches ,spreading it out evenly.</li>

       <li>In another bowl, combine the plain flour, plain oats, brown sugar, and caster sugar for the crumble topping.</li>

       <li>Add the cold cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the dry mixture until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs, if too dry add milk a tbsp at a time, I like large chunks but it's up to you how you want it! You can also use a pastry cutter for this.</li>

       <li>Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the fruit in the baking dish.</li>

       <li>Place in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, until the top is golden, and edges are bubbling in caramel fruity goodness. Leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>

       <li>Remove the crumble from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>

       <li>Serve your Apple and Pear Crumble warm, either on its own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</li>
    </ol>
